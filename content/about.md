My name is Gabriel Ferreira, I'm from Brazil, and I work as a Software Engineer. For most of my career, I developed [internal developer platforms](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/) to help the company's internal clients (usually developers), primarily seeking to improve their productivity and autonomy. I'm passionate about open-source, and I like to stay in touch with the community of projects I'm involved with.

Even though I worked with IDPs, I consider myself a Software Engineer instead of an SRE/DevOps Engineer. I used to say: I'm a software engineer working in the infrastructure **domain**.

My nickname Feggah came from the union of the first syllables of my first and last names, **Ga**briel **Fe**rreira. I didn't like **GaFe**, so I swapped the order to **FeGa** and stylized it a little, resulting in **Feggah**.
