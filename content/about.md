My name is Gabriel Ferreira, I'm from Brazil, I work as a Platform Engineer and I like to develop [internal developer platforms](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/) to help company's internal clients (usually developers), primarily seeking to improve their productivity and autonomy. I'm pasionate about open-source and I contribute to [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/), where I'm maintainer of the [provider-gcp](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-gcp) repository.

I came from development before entering to the DevOps space. This reflects at my work, because I'm a DevOps engineer who defends (and prefer) *developing over operating*.

My nickname Feggah came from the union of the first syllables of my first and last names, **Ga**briel **Fe**rreira. I didn't like **GaFe**, so I swapped the order to **FeGa** and stylized it a little, resulting in **Feggah**.
