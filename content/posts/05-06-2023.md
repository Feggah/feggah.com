When you are creating algorithms to deal with `strings` in Go, especially when using `for loops`, it's common to use either a regular `for loop` (using each item of the slice as a `byte`) or a `for range loop` (using each item as a `rune`). When choosing which one to use, you could have asked youself "Is there any difference?". That's what we are going to talk about in this post.

> Before going into the difference between `rune` and `byte`, it is important to note that a `string` in Go is, in effect, a read-only slice of bytes.

When trying to decide which one to use, you could write both of them to see what is the difference. See the example below:

```go
func main() {
    const str = "abc"
    for key, char := range str {
        fmt.Printf("%#v of type %T with index %#v\n", char, char, key)
        fmt.Printf("%#v of type %T with index %#v\n", str[key], str[key], key)
    }

    fmt.Println("===")

    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        fmt.Printf("%#v of type %T with index %#v\n", str[i], str[i], i)
    }
}
```

The output of the code above is:

```console
97 of type int32 with index 0
0x61 of type uint8 with index 0
98 of type int32 with index 1
0x62 of type uint8 with index 1
99 of type int32 with index 2
0x63 of type uint8 with index 2
===
0x61 of type uint8 with index 0
0x62 of type uint8 with index 1
0x63 of type uint8 with index 2
```

By analysing each type, when you index a string (`str[key]`) the value is going to be a `byte` (which is the same as `uint8`). If you use a `for range loop`, the `char` is going to be a `rune` (which is the same as `int32`).

Then you check if there are any differences between these types when converting back to a string.

```go
func main() {
    var charTest rune = 97
	var byteTest byte = 0x61

	fmt.Println(string(charTest), string(byteTest)) // output: a a
}
```

Well, so you could conclude that `byte` and `rune` are the same thing and can be used interchangeably, right?

Actually, **no**.

The key difference between these types is often misunderstood because a lot of programmers learned, wrongly, that _a character_ is stored in _one byte_. 

# Some historical context

In the "old-days", the only characters used were english letters. Each of them has a code called ASCII, which represent every character with a number between 32 and 127 -- and, conveniently, this could be stored in one byte.

<img src="/static/ascii.webp" style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%">

As time passed, a lot of nations wanted to have their characters in computers as well, but it was impossible to store all possible latin, chinese, arabic, russian and other characters in a single byte. We would have thousands of characters, which cannot be stored in 8 bits.

To solve this problem, Unicode was invented.

Simplifying things a lot, Unicode had the objective to create a single _character set_ that includes every possible character, symbols, etc. This means that a character cannot be **always** represented as a single byte. Some of them can be represented as one, two, up to six bytes.

In Unicode, one character maps to a _code point_, which is just an abstract concept. In practice, any letter/symbol/characters maps to a unique _code point_. You can think of it as the "UnicodeID" of a character.

# Code points and rune

Up until now, you know that a `string` is a slice of bytes and each character (_code point_) in a string can be represented as 1 to 6 bytes.

Go introduced a short therm for the Code Point concept: `rune`. This means that a rune is exactly the same as a Code Point. The only addition is that Go defines the word `rune` as an alias for the type `int32`, so that programs can be clear when an integer value represents a code point.

Going back to the question "Are `byte` and `rune` the same thing and can be used interchangeably?": the reason why we can't treat `byte` the same as `rune` is because a `rune` can be represented as multiple bytes.

It is easier to understand the difference if we use a character that is stored in more than 1 byte. Check the example below:

```golang
func main() {
    str := "Êó•Êú¨Ë™û"
	for key, char := range str {
		fmt.Printf("Character: %v. Type: %T. Value: %v. Index: %#v\n", string(char), char, char, key)
	}

	fmt.Println("===")

	for key := 0; key < len(str); key++ {
		fmt.Printf("Character: %v. Type: %T. Value: %v. Index: %#v\n", string(str[key]), str[key], str[key], key)
	}
}
```
> [Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/a1ctIaSs8n-) to run the above code.

The output of the code above is:

```console
Character: Êó•. Type: int32. Value: 26085. Index: 0
Character: Êú¨. Type: int32. Value: 26412. Index: 3
Character: Ë™û. Type: int32. Value: 35486. Index: 6
===
Character: √¶. Type: uint8. Value: 230. Index: 0
Character: . Type: uint8. Value: 151. Index: 1
Character: ¬•. Type: uint8. Value: 165. Index: 2
Character: √¶. Type: uint8. Value: 230. Index: 3
Character: . Type: uint8. Value: 156. Index: 4
Character: ¬¨. Type: uint8. Value: 172. Index: 5
Character: √®. Type: uint8. Value: 232. Index: 6
Character: ¬™. Type: uint8. Value: 170. Index: 7
Character: %
```

# Small challenge üòä

There is a LeetCode problem called [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/). Below you can check a possible solution for this problem:

```golang
func isAnagram(s string, t string) bool {
	if len(s) != len(t) {
		return false
	}

	sOccurrencies := make(map[byte]int, len(s))
	tOccurrencies := make(map[byte]int, len(t))
	for k := range s {
		sOccurrencies[s[k]] += 1
		tOccurrencies[t[k]] += 1
	}

	for k := range sOccurrencies {
		if sOccurrencies[k] != tOccurrencies[k] {
			return false
		}
	}

	return true
}
```
> [Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/c2h_N8N8DP1) to run the above code.

This code works fine for single-byte characters. How could you adapt the solution to work for any unicode character? Use the following `main` function to test it out:

```golang
func main() {
	fmt.Println(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")) // Works fine
    fmt.Println(isAnagram("„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ", "„Åì„Çì„Å∞„Çì„ÅØ")) // Wrong
	fmt.Println(isAnagram("„Å°", "„Çì")) // Wrong
}
```

# Conclusion

Using a `rune` when _for ranging looping_ makes your code compliant to any Unicode character, but if you treat characters as a single byte, your program could not behave as expected when dealing with characters stored in more than 1 byte.
